A Computer is an electronic device that is capable of storing, sharing and or-ganizing information (data). It consists of hardware and software components. OR
A computer is an electronic machine that performs calculations based on a set of instructions.
The computer systems of today are exponentially faster and only a frac-tion of the size of those original computers. A computer system consists of hardware and software components. Hardware is the physical equipment. It includes the case, keyboard, monitor, cables, storage drives, speakers, and printers. Software includes the operating system and programs.
1.1
Hardware is the physical mechanisms/components of a computer. All the physical structures of a computer, even the internal components are regarded as hardware components of a computer.

There are many different types of computers used for a variety of chores / tasks depending on their size and capabilities. The fundamen-tal concepts are how they relate to one another.
Laptop/ notebook computers
A laptop is a computer that can be carried or moved around and can be used in variety of sites. Laptops are similar to Desktop Computer/ Personal computer.
Mainframe computers
Main Frame computers are capable of handling and processing very large amounts of data quickly. Mainframe computers are used in large institutions such as government, banks and large corporations. They are measured in MIPS (million instructions per second) and respond to up to 100s of millions of users at a time.
Desktop computers
A desktop computer is a personal computer designed for regular use at a fixed location on or near a desk or table due to its size and is suita-ble for home and business usage.
Mini computers
Minicomputers are a class of multi-user a computer that lie in the mid-dle range of the computing spectrum, is usually used in small business.

A peripheral are different device used to put information into and get information out of the computer, they improve functionality of the computer.
Common peripherals include keyboards, computer mice, graphic tab-lets, touchscreens, barcode readers, image scanners, microphones, webcams, game controllers, light pens, and digital cameras. Common output peripherals include computer displays, printers, projectors, and computer speakers.
6.1
In computer hardware, a port serves as an interface between the com-puter and other computers or peripheral devices. In computer terms, a port generally refers to the female part of connection at the system unit. Computer ports have many uses, to connect a monitor, webcam, speakers, or other peripheral devices. On the physical layer, a computer port is a specialized outlet on a piece of tool to which a plug or cable connects. Electronically, the several con-ductors where the port and cable contacts connect provide a method to transfer signals between devices to assure a well-combined functionali-ty.

Hard Disk Drive
A hard disk drive (abbreviated as hard drive, HD, or HDD) is a non-volatile storage media hardware device that permanently stores and retrieves data on a computer. A hard drive consists of one or more platters to which data is written using a magnetic head, all inside of an air-Sealed casing. Internal hard disks reside in a drive bay, connect to the motherboard using an ATA, SCSI, or SATA cable, and are powered by a connection to the PSU (power supply unit).
A Floppy Disk Drive (FDD).
A floppy disk, also called a diskette or just disk, is a type of disk storage made of thin and flexi-ble magnetic, sealed in a rectangular plastic enclo-sure lined with fabric that removes dust particles. Floppy disks / Diskettes are read and written by
19
Floppy Disks / Stiffy disks (diskettes) are placed into disk drives to read data from or write data to. Stiffy disks are portable, i.e. you can take the disk from one machine to another. Stiffy disk drives are usually referred to as Drive A: or B:
Disks should never be bent, exposed to extreme temperatures, magnetic fields or dampness. Try to keep your fingers off the exposed areas of disks or you may damage the disk.
Disks can be 'write-protected' which means that you are unable to change the information stored on the disk in any way. To ‘write-protect’ a Stiffy disks, push the button into the 'write-protect' position.
Remember to remove the disk from the disk drive before switching off the machine.

Read-only memory (ROM) Is a non-volatile memory used in computers such as motherboards and other electronic devices. ROM is the permanent memory of a computer mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specif-ic hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.
Internal Arrangements of a computer
23
Random Access Memory (RAM)
Is the computer data memory which stores frequently used data / in-formation. To speed up the general speed of a working system. RAM is volatile types of memory where stored information is lost if power is turned off, although many efforts have been made to develop non-volatile RAM chips.
24
Central processing unit
A central processing unit (CPU) is the brain of the computer. Some-times referred to simply as the central processor, but more commonly called processor, the CPU is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place.
A power supply unit (or PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regu-lated DC power for the internal components of a computer. The function of a power supply is to convert one form of electrical energy to another and, as a result, power supplies are sometimes referred to as electric power changer. Some power supplies are discrete, stand-alone devices, whereas others are built into larger devices along with their loads.

Software is a collection of instructions that allows the user to interact with a computer, its hardware and software to be able complete tasks. A computer without software is useful.
There are two main categories of software.
 Operating System Software
 Application Software
9.1 An operating system (OS) is system software that manages com-puter hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.
 Controls the hardware and software, ensuring that all the parts of a computer system work together smoothly and efficiently
 Allowing the user to manage your files
 Acting as a go-between, between the user and the computer and the application programs.
 The operating system will also determine which programs will work.
Examples Operating System Software
 Microsoft Windows.
Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a graphical operating sys-tems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world's personal computer (PC) market with over 90% market share overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced in 1984.
Software
27
 Macintosh (Mac) OS.
The Macintosh (branded as Mac since 1998) is a series of personal computers (PCs) designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. Steve Jobs introduced the original Macintosh computer on January 10, 1984. This was the company's first mass-market personal comput-er featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse. This first model was later renamed to "Macintosh 128k" for uniqueness amongst a populous family of subsequently updated models which are also based on Apple's same proprietary architecture. Since 1998, Apple has largely phased out the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", and the product family has been nicknamed "Mac" or "the Mac" since the de-velopment of the first model.
 Android
Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on the Linux kernel and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devic-es such as smartphones and tablets. Android's user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch gestures that loosely corre-spond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard for text input. In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further devel-oped Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on notebooks, game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics.

Internet
What is the internet?
Is a collection of computers connected to one another generally using cables or wireless methods.
Or
A worldwide computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks.
1.1
The term broadband includes a broad range of technologies, all of which provide higher data rate access to the Internet. The following technolo-gies use wires or cables in contrast to wireless broadband.
Dial-up
Internet and Web Browsing
Types of internet connections
36
Dial-up Internet access uses a modem and a phone call placed over the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to connect to a pool of mo-dems operated by an ISP. The modem converts a computer's digital signal into an analog signal that travels over a phone line's local loop until it reaches a telephone company's switching facilities or central
Office (CO) where it is switched to another phone line that connects to another modem at the remote end of the connection.
Operating on a single channel, a dial-up connection monopolizes the phone line and is one of the slowest methods of accessing the Internet. Dial-up is often the only form of Internet access available in rural areas as it requires no new infrastructure beyond the already existing tele-phone network, to connect to the Internet. Typically, dial-up connections do not exceed a speed of 56 Kbit/s, as they are primarily made using modems that operate at a maximum data rate of 56 Kbit/s downstream (towards the end user) and 34 or 48 Kbit/s upstream (to-ward the global Internet).
Digital subscriber line (DSL, ADSL, SDSL, and VDSL)
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) service provides a connection to the In-ternet through the telephone network. Unlike dial-up, DSL can operate using a single phone line without preventing normal use of the tele-phone line for voice phone calls. DSL uses the high frequencies, while the low (audible) frequencies of the line are left free for regular tele-phone communication. These frequency bands are subsequently separated by filters installed at the customer's premises.
DSL originally stood for "digital subscriber loop". In telecommunica-tions marketing, the term digital subscriber line is widely understood to mean Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), the most commonly installed variety of DSL. The data throughput of consumer DSL services typically ranges from 256 Kbit/s to 20 Mbit/s in the direction to the customer (downstream), depending on DSL technology, line conditions,
37
and service-level implementation. In ADSL, the data throughput in the upstream direction, (i.e. in the direction to the service provider) is low-er than that in the downstream direction (i.e. to the customer), hence the designation of asymmetric. With a symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL), the downstream and upstream data rates are equal. Very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (VDSL or VHDSL, ITU G.993.1) is a digital subscriber line (DSL) standard approved in 2001 that provides data rates up to 52 Mbit/s downstream and 16 Mbit/s upstream over copper wires and up to 85 Mbit/s down- and upstream on coaxial cable. VDSL is capable of supporting applications such as high-definition television, as well as telephone services (voice over IP) and general Internet ac-cess, over a single physical connection.
VDSL2 (ITU-T G.993.2) is a second-generation version and an enhance-ment of VDSL. Approved in February 2006, it is able to provide data rates exceeding 100 Mbit/s simultaneously in both the upstream and downstream directions. However, the maximum data rate is achieved at a range of about 300 meters and performance degrades as distance and loop attenuation increases.
Power-line Internet
Power-line Internet, also known as Broadband over power lines (BPL), carries Internet data on a conductor that is also used for electric power transmission. Because of the extensive power line infrastructure al-ready in place, this technology can provide people in rural and low population areas access to the Internet with little cost in terms of new transmission equipment, cables, or wires. Data rates are asymmetric and generally range from 256 Kbit/s to 2.7 Mbit/s.
Because these systems use parts of the radio spectrum allocated to oth-er over-the-air communication services, interference between the services is a limiting factor in the introduction of power-line Internet systems. The IEEE P1901 standard specifies that all power-line proto-cols must detect existing usage and avoid interfering with it.
38
Power-line Internet has developed faster in Europe than in the U.S. due to a historical difference in power system design philosophies. Data sig-nals cannot pass through the step-down transformers used and so a repeater must be installed on each transformer. In the U.S. a transform-er serves a small cluster of from one to a few houses. In Europe, it is more common for a somewhat larger transformer to service larger clus-ters of from 10 to 100 houses. Thus a typical U.S. city requires an order of magnitude more repeaters than in a comparable European city
Satellite broadband
Satellite Internet access via VSAT in Ghana
Satellite Internet access provides fixed, portable, and mobile Internet access. Data rates range from 2 Kbit/s to 1 Gbit/s downstream and from 2 Kbit/s to 10 Mbit/s upstream. In the northern hemisphere, satellite antenna dishes require a clear line of sight to the southern sky, due to the equatorial position of all geostationary satellites. In the southern hemisphere, this situation is reversed, and dishes are pointed north. Service can be adversely affected by moisture, rain, and snow (known as rain fade). The system requires a carefully aimed directional antenna.
Satellites in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) operate in a fixed position 35,786 km (22,236 miles) above the Earth's equator. At the speed of light (about 300,000 km/s or 186,000 miles per second), it takes a quar-ter of a second for a radio signal to travel from the Earth to the satellite and back. When other switching and routing delays are added and the delays are doubled to allow for a full round-trip transmission, the total delay can be 0.75 to 1.25 seconds. This latency is large when compared to other forms of Internet access with typical latencies that range from 0.015 to 0.2 seconds. Long latencies negatively affect some applications that require real-time response, particularly online games, voice over IP, and remote control devices.
39
TCP tuning and TCP acceleration techniques can mitigate some of these problems. GEO satellites do not cover the Earth's polar re-gions.HughesNet; Exede, AT&T and Dish Network have GEO systems.
Satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO, below 2000 km or 1243 miles) and medium Earth orbit (MEO, between 2000 and 35,786 km or 1,243 and 22,236 miles) are less common, operate at lower altitudes, and are not fixed in their position above the Earth. Lower altitudes allow lower la-tencies and make real-time interactive Internet applications more feasible. LEO systems include Global star and Iridium. The O3b Satellite Constellation is a proposed MEO system with latency of 125 ms. COMMStellation™ is a LEO system, scheduled for launch in 2015, that is expected to have a latency of just 7 ms.
Mobile broadband
Service mark for GSMA
Mobile broadband is the marketing term for wireless Internet access delivered through mobile phone towers to computers, mobile phones (called "cell phones" in North America and South Africa, and "hand phones" in Asia), and other digital devices using portable modems. Some mobile services allow more than one device to be connected to the Internet using a single cellular connection using a process called tethering. The modem may be built into laptop computers, tablets, mo-bile phones, and other devices, added to some devices using PC cards, USB modems, and USB sticks or dongles, or separate wireless modems can be used.
New mobile phone technology and infrastructure is introduced periodi-cally and generally involves a change in the fundamental nature of the service, non-backwards-compatible transmission technology, higher peak data rates, new frequency bands, wider channel frequency band-width in Hertz becomes available. These transitions are referred to as
40
generations. The first mobile data services became available during the second generation (2G).
Wireless ISP
Wi-Fi logo
Wireless Internet service providers (WISPs) operate independently of mobile phone operators. WISPs typically employ low-cost IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi radio systems to link up remote locations over great distances (Long-range Wi-Fi), but may use other higher-power radio communica-tions systems as well.
Traditional 802.11b is an unlicensed omnidirectional service designed to span between 100 and 150 m (300 to 500 ft.). By focusing the radio signal using a directional antenna 802.11b can operate reliably over a distance of many km(miles), although the technology's line-of-sight re-quirements hamper connectivity in areas with hilly or heavily foliated terrain. In addition, compared to hard-wired connectivity, there are se-curity risks (unless robust security protocols are enabled); data rates are significantly slower (2 to 50 times slower); and the network can be less stable, due to interference from other wireless devices and net-works, weather and line-of-sight problems.
Deploying multiple adjacent Wi-Fi access points is sometimes used to create city-wide wireless networks. Some are by commercial WISPs but grassroots efforts have also led to wireless community networks. Rural wireless-ISP installations are typically not commercial in nature and are instead a patchwork of systems built up by hobbyists mounting anten-nas on radio masts and towers, agricultural storage silos, very tall trees, or whatever other tall objects are available. There are a number of companies that provide this service. Proprietary technologies like Motorola Canopy & Expedience can be used by a WISP to offer wireless

access to rural and other markets that are hard to reach using Wi-Fi or WiMAX

Internet Explorer (formerly Microsoft Internet Explorer and Windows Internet Explorer, commonly abbreviated IE or MSIE) is a discontinued series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included as part of the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995.
It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year.
Navigating around internet explorer
What version of Internet Explorer can I use on my computer?
This depends on which Windows operating system you're using:
 If you're using Windows 10, the most recent version you can use is IE 11, but Microsoft Edge will be your default browser.
 If you're using Windows 7 or 8.1, the most recent version you can use is IE 11.
 If you're using Vista, the newest version for your computer is IE 9.
 If you're using Windows XP, the most recent version you can use is IE 8.
IE 11 has two versions for Windows 8.1: one for the Start screen, and one for the Desktop. We'll talk about both in this tutorial.
How do I know which version of IE I have?
Internet Explorer
52
Navigate to Settings in your browser and select About Internet Ex-plorer (or about in some versions of IE). You'll then be able to see the version number you're using.
Alternatively, navigate to this webpage while using Internet Explorer. This will tell you which version of IE you're using.
How do I get IE?
If you're using Windows, some version of IE comes pre-installed on your computer. If your computer automatically installs updates for Windows, new versions of IE will be installed as updates. Otherwise, you can download the most recent version of IE for your operating sys-tem directly from Microsoft.
53
 If you have Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, IE 11 is already in-stalled on your computer or tablet.
 If you have Windows 8, you can get IE 11 by updating to Win-dows 8.1. To learn how, you can review the instructions here.
 To download IE 11 for Windows 7, go here and follow the in-structions.
 To download IE 9, go here and follow the instructions.
 To download IE 8, go here and follow the instructions.
Navigation Buttons

Browsing with Internet Explorer 11
Internet Explorer 11 makes browsing online easy. In this lesson, we'll talk about navigating to websites using Internet Explorer. You'll also
55
learn how to use tabs, access your browsing history, and view your downloads.
If you don't have a lot of experience with web browsers, you may want to review our lesson on Using a Web Browser, which covers the basic points of web browsing in more detail.
To navigate to a website:
1. Type a web address—also known as a URL—into the address bar, then press Enter.
2. The website will appear.
To search the web:
Some browsers use an address bar for navigating to websites and a search bar for conducting web searches. Internet Explorer 11 com-bines both of these functions into the address bar.
1. Click the address bar and begin typing search terms. As you're typing, Internet Explorer will display suggestions for search terms and related websites. You may also see History results, which are websites you've previously visited.
2. Click one of the suggestions to navigate to a website or see search results. You can also finish typing your search term and press Enter. The search results will appear.
56
If you don't want the browser to suggest search terms as you type, click Turn off suggestions (stop sending keystrokes to Google).
Internet Explorer uses the Bing search engine by default. If you want to use a different search engine, like Google or Yahoo!, click the Add button. The Internet Explorer Gallery will open in a new tab. From here, you can add different search engines.
57
Navigation buttons
Internet Explorer uses four buttons for navigation: the Back, Forward, Refresh, and Home buttons.
 The Back and Forward buttons allow you to move through pages you've recently viewed. Click and hold either button to view your recent history.
58
The Refresh button will reload the current page.
To open a new window:
1. Right-click the top of the browser window and select Menu bar. The menu bar will appear.
2. Click File, then select new window. You can also press Ctrl+N on your keyboard.
3. A new window will appear.

3.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of Internet Explorer
Advantages
 One of the major advantages of IE is that it is available for free.
 It has reached all nations with internet connectivity.
 It is also present by default with any version of Windows operating system. However, some specific features associated with Internet Explorer denote its advantages or disadvantages over contempo-rary web browsers. Internet Explorer, a web browser with potential benefits and conventional disadvantages.
The versions 9 and above of Internet Explorer use HTML 5, which en-hances browsing experience. This lets a user stream videos and audios exempting any requirements of installing additional plugins IE being one of the oldest and conventional web browsers support a broad array of applications, which some modern web browsers may not support. IE aids in reopening latest browsing sessions, which a user might have ac-cidentally closed.
Disadvantages
Users may face an issue regarding the speed of Internet Explorer. Sur-veys reveal that though IE is a conventional web browser, it is considered slower than Google Chrome in some regions. There are lim-ited options for customization in Internet Explorer. Compared to Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, IE offers fewer add-ons, extensions and plugins. Alternating various features of Internet Explorer through plugins and extensions are not that possible with internet Explorer.
Users may find it less fascinating to stick to the same appearance of their primary web browser. Customization of tool bars is also quite lim-ited on IE. There is no track filtering feature in IE. You cannot import or
60
store a customized list of blocked websites. Security implements on Internet Explorer still need to be improved. As it is a conventional web browser, phishing attacks and scam organizers target IE the most. So, tech-surveys often emphasize on farther improvement of Internet Ex-plorer security tools. 4. E-mail is a method of sending and receiving messages over a computer network. Messages can include documents created using other software applications (word processing, spreadsheets). You can send a message to the other side of the world within minutes.
To use e-mail you need a computer connected to a network, e-mail software and an email address. The address is registered with an e-mail server on the network. The network connection could be to a LAN or WAN.
When you have sent a message, it is stored at an e-mail post office until the receiver checks for mail. The “post office” could be a central com-puter on a LAN or at an ISP (Internet Service Provider). The ISP gives you access to the Internet.
If you have a home computer, messages usually have to be sent over a telephone wire, and the text message is converted using a modem into audible tones so that the telephone wire can transport it.

Your document, called “Document1,” is stored in your computer’s temporary memory. Until you name and save the document, the data can be lost if you have a power failure or a computer hardware problem. It is always good prac-tice to save your work frequently. The first step in saving a document for future use is to assign a file name. Study the following rules about naming documents:
 File names can contain up to 260 characters, including the drive letter, the folder name, and extension. The following characters cannot be used in a file name: / \ > < *? ” : |
 File names can include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or a combina-tion of both. They can also include spaces. For example, a file can be named “Business Plan.”
 Throughout this course, document file names will consist of [your initials] (which might be your initials or the identifier your instructor asks you to use, such as rst ), followed by the number of the exercise, such as 1-12 . The file name would, therefore, be rst1-12 .You can use either

86
the Save command or the Save As command to save a document.
Here are some guidelines about saving documents:
 Use Save As when you name and save a document the first time.
 Use Save As when you save an existing document under a new
name. Save as creates an entirely new file and leaves the original
document unchanged.
Use Save to update an existing document. Before you save a new document,
decide where you want to save it. Word saves documents in the
current drive and folder unless you specify otherwise. For example, to
save a document to a removable storage device, you need to change the
drive to F: or whichever is appropriate for your computer. Document
files are typically stored in folders that are part of a hierarchal structure
similar to a family tree. At the top of the tree is a disk drive letter (such
as C:) that represents your computer, network, removable storage device,
or CD/DVD drive. Under the disk drive letter, you can create
folders to organize your files. These folders can also contain additional
folders.
 Click the File tab to open the backstage view, and click Save As .
The Save As dialog box appears. The appearance of the Save As
dialog box is determined by the operating system.
87
To save a document as a PDF file, open the Save As dialog box, choose
the appropriate drive and folder for saving the document, key the file
name, open the Save as type drop-down list, and choose PDF (*.pdf). Click Save.
 Locate the File name text box. A suggested file name is highlighted. Replace
this file name by keying.
 Drag the scroll box in the Navigation Pane, and choose the appropriate
drive for your removable storage device—Removable Disk (F:), for example.
 Click the New Folder button. A New Folder icon appears in the File list
section. Key the folder name [your initials] Lesson1, and press Enter.
The folder name appears in the Address bar and in the Navigation
Pane. Word is ready to save the file in the new folder.
 Click the Save button. Your document is named and saved for future
use.
 Open the File tab and click Close. The Close command in backstage
view closes the current document but does not exit the Word program.
If you click the Close button located on the title bar and no other documents

Excel files are called workbooks. Whenever you start a new workbook in Excel, you'll need to create a new workbook. There are several ways to start working with a workbook in Excel. You can choose to create a new workbook—either with a blank workbook or a pre-designed template—or open an existing workbook.
Cells are the basic building blocks of a worksheet; each and every data will be inserted into the cell or blocks.
Opening the program
Creating and Opening Workbooks
99
By default, every row and column of a new workbook is set to the same height and width. Excel allows you to modify column width and row height in different ways, including wrapping text and merging cells.
Mouse Pointer
- I-beam
- Move
- Change column width and row height.
- Copy
- Auto fill (Dragging mouse) e.g. month dates etc.
Inserting data with the auto fill.
 Type Monday.
 Position the mouse pointer at the bottom left corner of the cell or hover around at the bottom left of the cell. The shape of the pointer will change to the auto fill adjustment handle (+) then click and drag either horizontally or vertically.

104
N.B
Operating systems may result in different functionality of the program functions.
A Microsoft Excel workbook is a file with one or more worksheets (or spreadsheets).
Value cells
 Value cells can only contain numbers, + - ( ), / %. E e and sometimes R
 All other combinations of numbers and alpha characters (letters) or symbols are treated as text
 When you enter a value cell, the number is aligned on the right-hand side of the cell
 Values may be displayed as ######## when the column is not wide enough to display the number or Text.
 Values may be displayed in scientific notation (9.858E+21) if the column is not wide enough to display the number.
Formatting Cells
1. Select the cell(s) you want to modify.
2. On the Home tab, click the drop-down arrow next to the Font Size command, then select the desired font size. In our example, we will choose 24 to make the text larger
3. Align.
Text is automatically aligns on the left of the cell and numbers align on the right. You can change this alignment by choosing left, right or cen-tred for a selection range of cells.
105
How to align data in a cell:
Select the cells to be aligned.
Choose home ribbon tabs alignment command and select the Alignment Tab to display the dialogue box.
Choose the Horizontal or Vertical placement, Orientation or Text con-trol options.
Click on the OK button.
To change the font color:
1. Select the cell you want to modify.
2. Home tab, click the drop-down arrow next to the Font Col-or command, then select the desired font color.
106
To use the Bold, Italic, and Underline commands:
1. Select the cell(s) you want to modify.
2. Click the Bold (B), Italic (I), or Underline (U) command on the Home tab. In our example, we'll make the selected cells bold.
3. The selected style will be applied to the text.
107
Cell borders and fill colors
 Cell borders and fill colors allow you to create bright and defined boundaries for different sections of your worksheet. Below, we'll add cell borders and fill color to our worksheet to help distinguish them from the rest of the worksheet.
 The selected fill color will appear in the selected cells.
108
Adding borders:
 Select the cells you want to modify. You can draw borders and change the line style and color of borders with the Draw Bor-ders tools at the bottom of the Borders drop-down menu.
Border
109
 On the Home tab, click the drop-down arrow next to the Borders command, then select the border style you want to use.
2.
Entering basic formulas
A formula is an instruction to calculate. After entering a formula the an-swer appears in the cell as a value and the formula can be read in the formula bar. Formulas can contain values (e.g. 10, 29, 20), cell address-es (e.g. B10, A15) and operators.
To enter formulas:
Calculations in Worksheets
110
To enter a formula which adds the value in A1 to the value in B1?
Click on the cell where you want the answer to appear E.g.
 Type (5) A1, (12) B1
 C1 type =a1+ b1
 Press the enter key ANSWER
 Formula cells contain calculations which can be seen in the Formula bar, but the result is displayed in the cell.
111
Calculations
Working with arguments
Arguments can refer to both individual cells and cell ranges and must be enclosed within parentheses. You can include one argument or mul-tiple arguments, depending on the syntax required for the function.
For example, the function =AVERAGE (B1:B9) would calculate the average of the values in the cell range B1:B9. This function contains only one argument.
112
Multiple arguments must be separated by a comma. For example, the function =SUM (A1:A3, C1:C2, E1) will add the values of all of the cells in the three arguments.
Entering formulas with more than one operation
When using more than one operation in a formula, a different answer will be reached depending on the order in which the calculations take place.
For example:
2 + 3 x 2 = 10
Or, if the multiplication happens first then:
2 + 3 x 2 = 8
In Excel, no matter in what order you enter the formula, calculations will take place in this order:
Brackets ()
Of
Divide /
113
Multiply *
Add +
Subtract –
As brackets always come first, use brackets to indicate which operation should be calculated first!!
(2 + 3) x 2 = 8
Excel will first multiply and then add unless you use brackets to indicate a different operation should happen first.
To create a function using the AutoSum command:
Functions in Excel are used you to perform fairly complicated calcula-tions without having to type the whole formula out. Instead of entering the formula with operators, you enter the function name with argu-ments
The most commonly used function is the =SUM ( )
To add up a column of numbers using operators a formula could look like this:
=B5+B6+B7+B8+B9+B10
The Sum function for the same calculation above would look like:
=Sum (B5:B10)
HOW
To enter a Sum by typing:
Click on the cell where you want the formula
114
Type =Sum (
Use the mouse to point to the first cell and while hold down the left mouse button drag to highlight all the cells you want added together
Type)
Press Enter
To enter a Sum using the AutoSum Tool:
Click on the cell where you want the formula
Click once on the AutoSum tool
If the selected range appears to be correct, click on the AutoSum tool again or
Press Enter to accept.
If Excel is not able to automatically select the correct range, use your mouse or
Keyboard to correct this and press Enter to accept.
In this example, after clicking on AutoSum Excel guessed that we would also like to add the
Column heading (1991), which is incorrect.
115
To change this, reselect the range to be included in the formula by click-ing on the first cell under
The heading and while holding down the left mouse button, drag the mouse pointer to the last
Number in the list, and then press Enter.
HOW to enter an AutoSum by selecting the data first:
Select the values to be added with a blank cell at the end of the selection
Click once on the AutoSum tool
Excel will enter the correct formula to add up all the values that you se-lected and will always place the formula in the blank cell at the end of the range you selected.
116
Move or copy a sheet:
Right click on the tab of the sheet you want to move and choose the Move or Copy command to display the dialogue box
 move or copy using the mouse to drag:
 Insert and delete sheets
 Worksheet groups
Using templates
A template is a predesigned spreadsheet you can use to create a new workbook quickly. Templates often include formatting and predefined formulas.
Moving and copying sheets
117
To create a new workbook from a template:
1. Click the File tab to access backstage view.
2. Select New. Several templates will appear below the Blank work-book option.
118
2.1
Number formats
Make your spreadsheet easier to read—they also make it easier to use. When you apply a number format, you're telling your spreadsheet ex-actly what types of values are stored in a cell. For example, the date format tells the spreadsheet that you're entering specific calendar dates. This allows the spreadsheet to better understand your data, which can help ensure that your data remains consistent and that your formulas are calculated correctly.
If you don't need to use a specific number format, the spreadsheet will usually apply the general number format by default. However, the gen-eral format may apply some small formatting changes to your data.
Applying number formats
Just like other types of formatting, such as changing the font color, you'll apply number formats by selecting cells and choosing the desired for-matting option. There are two main ways to choose a number format:
 Go to the Home tab, click the Number Format drop-down menu in the Number group, and select the desired format.
119
 You can also click one of the quick number-formatting commands below the drop-down menu.
You can also select the desired cells and press Ctrl+1 on your keyboard to access more number-formatting options.
In this example, we've applied the Currency number format, which adds currency symbols ($) and displays two decimal places for any nu-merical values.
120
If you select any cells with number formatting, you can see the actual value of the cell in the formula bar. The spreadsheet will use this value for formulas and other calculations.
Using number formats correctly
There's more to number formatting than selecting cells and applying a format. Spreadsheets can actually apply a lot of number format-ting automatically based on the way you enter data. This means you'll need to enter data in a way the program can understand, and then en-sure that those cells are using the proper number format. For example, the image below shows how to use number formats correctly for dates, percentages, and times:
121
3.
1. Right-click the worksheet you want to rename, then se-lect Rename from the worksheet menu.
2. Type the desired name for the worksheet.
3. Click anywhere outside the worksheet tab, or press Enter on your keyboard. The worksheet will be renamed.
Renaming a worksheet
122
To change the worksheet tab color
1. Right-click the desired worksheet tab, and hover the mouse over Tab Color. The Color menu will appear.
2. Select the desired color.
3. The worksheet tab color will be changed.
Tip: The worksheet tab color is considerably less noticeable when the worksheet is selected. Select another worksheet to see how the color will appear when the worksheet is not selected e.g. diagram above saint Ignatious is not selected, sheet is the active one.
Deleting a worksheet:
1. Right-click the worksheet you want to delete, then se-lect Delete from the worksheet menu.
123
2. The worksheet will be deleted from your workbook.
Protect your worksheets from being edited or deleted, you can protect them by right-clicking the desired worksheet and select-ing Protect Sheet from the worksheet menu. Right click the sheets you want to keep safe and select protect.

 Ribbon – To navigate Microsoft Office 2010, the Ribbon (located at the top of the document) is used. The Ribbon replaces menus, toolbars and most of the task panes used in earlier versions of Mi-crosoft Office. The Ribbon is composed of Tabs (e.g., Home, Insert, etc.) which are organized by tasks or objects. Each tab is divided in-to groups (on the Home tab is the Slides, Font, Paragraph groups, etc. Each group contains command buttons which allow for a differ-ent set of modifications to be applied to your presentation.
 File – To create a new presentation, open an existing one, save, print, and perform other tasks, the Office Button is used. It is located in the top left corner of the Ribbon.
 Quick Access Toolbar – To the right of the Office Button is the Quick Access Toolbar. The default options are Save, Undo Typing and Redo Typing. Tabs – These are used to access tools and com-mands.
 The Status Bar – Located at the bottom of the screen, the Status bar contains information about the active presentation, View buttons and Zoom controls. To customize the bar, right click on the bar. A list of options will appear.
 Thumbnails: - This area displays thumbnails of each slide in the presentation to allow you to see several slides at a glance.
 Notes: - This area is used to enter notes for the presenter to refer to during a presentation. Notes are not displayed on the actual slide on the screen. A separate option allows the presenter to print the notes.
 The Zoom option: - Icons appear in this corner to allow the user to quickly zoom in or out.
129
 Slide Views: - The information you typed for your first slide is dis-played in Normal view. On the right side of the Status bar there are three small buttons.
 These buttons are (left to right):
- Normal View
- Slide Sorter View
- Slide Show
 In the left panel there are two tabs: Slides and Outline. The default view and the one we are currently in is called Slide view. Place-holders: - Text boxes appear on the slides to assist the user in placing text. Each slide layout has its own placeholders.

1.2
Planning is probably the most important step in creating a successful presentation of any kind. Planning helps you decide on the content and the order in which the information will be presented. When you pre-pare a presentation, use the following steps as a guide in planning the presentation.
 Determine the Purpose of the Presentation
 Is this presentation about a product for a client?
 Is it a business presentation about the latest sales figures?
 Is it about a new idea you are introducing?
 Determine the Presentation’s Audience your staff
 a new prospective client
 a group of small children
 a convention for people in the same line of work -- for example;
 A group of Computer Facilitators.
 Gather Your Information
 List no more than four points per slide.
 Determine the Order of Your Slides
 Although this can be changed later, having a rough idea of the order of your Topic points will help you plan the order of your slides.
 Check your work regularly for any errors that may ruin your presentation.
Presentation Principles
131
1. Use Key Phrases about Your Topic
Seasoned presenters use key phrases and include only essential infor-mation. Choose only the top three or four points about your topic and make them consistently throughout the delivery. Simplify and limit the number of words on each screen. Try not to use more than three bullets per slide. The surrounding space will make it easier to read.
2. Slide Layout is Important
Make your slides easy to follow. Put the title at the top of the slide where your audience expects to find it. Phrases should read left to right and top to bottom. Keep important information near the top of the slide. Often the bottom portions of slides cannot be seen from the back rows because heads are in the way.
3. Limit Punctuation and avoid using All Capital Letters
Punctuation can needlessly clutter the slide and the use of all caps makes statements more difficult to read and is like SHOUTING at your audience.
4. Avoid Fancy Fonts
Choose a font that is simple and easy to read such as Arial, Times New Roman or Verdana. Avoid script type fonts as they are hard to read on screen. Try to use no more than two different fonts –one for headings and another for content. Keep all fonts large enough (at least 24 pt. and preferably 30 pt.) so that people at the back of the room will be able to easily read what is on the screen.
5. Use Contrasting Colours for Text and Background
Dark text on a light background is best, but avoid white backgrounds -- tone it down by using beige or another light colour that will be easy on the eyes. Dark backgrounds are effective to show off company colours or if you just want to dazzle the crowd. In that case, be sure to make text a light colour for easy reading. Patterned or textured backgrounds can

reduce readability of text. Keep your colour scheme consistent through-out your presentation.
6. Use Slide Designs Effectively
When using a design theme choose one that is appropriate for the audi-ence. A clean, straightforward layout is best if you are presenting to business clientele. Select one that is full of colour and contains a variety of shapes if your presentation is aimed at young children.
7. Limit the Number of Slides 4
Keeping the number of slides to a minimum ensures that the presenta-tion will not become too long and drawn out. It also avoids the problem
Of continually changing slides during the presentation that can be a dis-traction to your audience. On average, one slide per minute is about right.
8. Use Photos, Charts and Graphs
Combining photos, charts and graphs and even embedding digitized videos with text, will add variety and keep your audience interested in the presentation. Avoid having text only slides.
9. Avoid Excessive Use of Slide Transitions and Animations
While transitions and animations can heighten your audience’s interest in the presentation, too much of a good thing can distract them from what you are saying. Remember, the slide show is meant to be a visual aid, not the focus of the presentation. Keep animations consistent in the presentation by using animation schemes and apply the same transition throughout the presentation.
10. Make Sure Your Presentation Can Run On Any Computer
Use PowerPoint's Package for CD feature when burning your presenta-tion onto a CD. In addition to your presentation, a copy of Microsoft’s PowerPoint Viewer is added to the CD to run PowerPoint presentations on computers that don't have PowerPoint installed.

Presentations – whether they are made with PowerPoint or other appli-cations, are a great way to support a speech, visualize complicated concepts or focus attention on a subject. However, a bad presentation can achieve the opposite. Badly designed slides with too much text or bad graphics can distract or worse, irritate the audience.
Compose Slides
 Don’t copy & paste slides from different sources.
 Keep the design very basic and simple. It shall not distract.
 Pick an easy to read font face.
 Carefully select font sizes for headers and text.
 Leave room for highlights, such as images or take home messages.
 Decorate scarcely but well.
 Restrict the room your design takes up and don’t ever let the design restrict your message.
Use Consistency
 Consistently use the same font face and sizes on all slides.
 Match colours.
You may use your company logo, highlight headers, create a spe-cial frame for figures/images or the whole slide but don’t overload your slides with these elements.
Colours
A poor choice of colours can shatter a presentation.
